# Howdy!


Hello, I am an undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. I am interested in
Robotics and Artificial Intelligence techniques. I am studying ROS with the book
called 'ROS Robotics Projects 2nd edition' by by Ramkumar Gandhinathan.

Up until I finish up the book, I am going to use this blog to post some errors
and difficulties that I have encountered and some useful debugging/solutions
I found as I study the materials in the book.

This is my first time starting a blog and sharing some useful informations and
knowledge that I am interested in.

Please, feel free to make any corrections/suggestions if I make any mistakes.

My next blog post will be about the ROS1 & ROS2 installations on docker that has
been installed in my MacBook Air machine with Ubuntu 18.04.
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
* ROS Melodic Morenia
