# Welcome

Hello, I am studying ROS with the book 'ROS Robotics Projects 2nd edition.'

From now on, I am going to use this blog to post some errors and difficulties
that I have encountered and some useful solutions I found as I study the
materials in the book.

This is my first time running a blog and share some useful informations with
the people out there.

Please, feel free to make any corrections/suggestions if I make mistakes.

My next blog post will be about the ROS1 & ROS2 installations on docker that is
installed in my Macbook Air machine with Ubuntu 18.04.
